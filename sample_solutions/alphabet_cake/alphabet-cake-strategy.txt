Alphabet-Cake

Approach 1:
Start at a letter, draw a bounding box around it that include only '?'

Approach 2 (my implementation and I think its simpler):
Fill up each row:
1) Scan each row, extend each letter into cells to the right of that letter until we reach another letter or the end of the row.
2) You end up with empty cells to the left of the rows. Extend the left most letter to the cells to the left of that letter.
3) Any rows without letters are still empty. Scan each row. For each empty row, replace it with the row above it.
4) Any remaining rows are at the top of the grid. Find the first non-empty row and extend to the rows above it.
